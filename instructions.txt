## The Task: Memory Card Game with a Twist
Create an interactive memory card game. This is your chance to show off your TypeScript skills and creativity!

### Base Requirements
1. Create a memory card game with:
   - 4x4 grid of cards (8 matching pairs)
   - Card flip animations on click
   - Move counter
   - Timer display
   - Win condition check

2. Implement at least 2 of these special features:
   - **Power-Up System**: Random power-up cards that appear during gameplay
     - "Peek": Reveals all cards for 1 second
     - "Extra Time": Adds 30 seconds to the timer
     - Power-ups should vanish if not used within 3 turns
   
   - **Multi-Select Mode**: 
     - Add a toggle between normal and multi-select modes
     - Allow selecting up to 3 cards at once
     - Match any pairs within the selection
   
   - **Progressive Difficulty**: 
     - After winning, start a new round with added complexity
     - Cards have both shapes AND colors
     - Players must match both properties

### Technical Requirements
- Use TypeScript
- Create your own state management (no Redux/Vuex/etc.)
- Include loading states and error handling

### Bonus Points (Optional)
- Keyboard controls
- Smooth animations for card flips 
- Local storage for high scores
- Unit tests for game logic
- Clear documentation
- Clean commit history 

## What We're Looking For
1. **Clean, maintainable code**
   - Good component structure
   - Clear TypeScript types
   - Readable and well-documented code

2. **Problem-solving ability**
   - How you handle game logic
   - How you manage application state
   - How you deal with edge cases

3. **Attention to detail**
   - User experience
   - Error handling
   - Code organization

## Submission Guidelines
1. Create a new GitHub repository for your solution
2. Include a README.md with:
   - Setup instructions
   - Brief explanation of your technical choices
   - Any assumptions or trade-offs you made
   - Which special features you implemented
   - What you would improve with more time
