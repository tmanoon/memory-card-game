## Special Features

- **Multi-Select Mode**: Players can select up to three cards to find matching pairs.
- **Card Flip Animations**: Smooth animations enhance the user experience when flipping cards.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: After winning, players can start a new round with added complexity
- **Colors And Shapes**: The cards have both shapes and colors

## Technologies Used

- **Core Technologies**: HTML, CSS, TypeScript
- **Project Tooling**: TypeScript Compiler (TSC) for file compilation

## Setup Instructions

This project is designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages. To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/memory-card-game.git

2. **Navigate to project folder:**
    cd memory-card-game

3. **Download all the necessary dependencies:**
    npm install

4. **Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:**
    tsc

5. **Use LiveServer extension in VSCode to run it locally.**

## Usage

**Start the Game:** Open the index.html file in your browser or use LiveServer.
**Select Cards:** Click on the cards to flip them and see if they match.
**Keep Track:** Monitor your moves and time as you play.

## Technical Choices

In this project, I chose to implement the game logic using TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability. The use of vanilla HTML and CSS ensures a lightweight and customizable UI, while avoiding the overhead of frameworks. I focused on creating a responsive design and smooth animations to enhance the user experience.

## Assumptions

I assumed that players would appreciate a more traditional approach to game development without relying on heavy libraries or frameworks. This allowed for a deeper understanding of game mechanics and state management, which is often abstracted away in more complex frameworks.
